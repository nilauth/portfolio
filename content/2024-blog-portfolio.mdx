When planning the development of my portfolio website and blog, my initial choice was to use Next.js, especially since version 14 had just been released, boasting fewer changes, improved performance, and more stable features.

However, when it came to deciding on the technology for the blog, I found myself facing a myriad of options, each with its own set of considerations. I explored various Content Management Systems (CMS) and delved into the documentation of <ExternalLink url="https://payloadcms.com/">Payload</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink url="https://www.sanity.io/">Sanity.io</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink url="https://pocketbase.io/">Pocketbase</ExternalLink>, and <ExternalLink url="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</ExternalLink>. Despite having no prior experience with Pocketbase, its intriguing features caught my attention, while my familiarity with Supabase made it a tempting choice.

Feeling overwhelmed, I decided to gather more insights by embarking on a blog tour, exploring the preferences of other developers. DHH blog crossed my mind, given my enjoyment of his content. However, his use of Ruby didn't align with my preference for a more React-centric ecosystem. Turning my attention to the Vercel staff blogs, I stumbled upon exactly what I needed in Lee Robinson's <ExternalLink url="https://leerob.io/blog/2023">detailed blog post</ExternalLink>. He elucidated why he chose <ExternalLink url="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</ExternalLink> and meticulously explained his approach.

In summary, my decision to use Next.js for the portfolio website was affirmed by version 14's advantages. For the blog, I found inspiration and clarity in Lee Robinson's choice of MDX, backed by a comprehensive blog post on his methodology.
