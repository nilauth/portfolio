        engineering student with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the
        physical world. From a young age, Nizar was fascinated by how things
        worked, from the simple mechanisms of a bicycle to the complex inner
        workings of electronic devices. This early curiosity paved the way for a
        journey into the realm of engineering. Currently pursuing a degree in
        mechanical engineering at a prestigious university, Nizar thrives on the
        challenges posed by the dynamic field. The academic journey is no easy
        feat, but Nizar&apos;s determination and inquisitive nature make every
        obstacle an opportunity to learn and grow.
